React Fiber architecture is the **reconciliation engine introduced in React 16** to make React applications faster, smoother, and more capable of handling complex UIs. It’s essentially a complete **reimplementation of React’s core algorithm** for rendering and updating the UI.

---

## Why Fiber was introduced (the problem with React 15 and earlier)

Before Fiber, React used a **stack-based reconciliation algorithm**:

* When state or props changed, React would **recursively render the entire component tree synchronously**.
* This worked fine for small trees but caused:

  * **Blocking of the main thread** (slow updates).
  * **No way to pause, prioritize, or abort rendering**.
  * **Janky UI** for large apps or animations.

---

## What is Fiber?

A **Fiber** is a **JavaScript object that represents a unit of work (a component) in the React tree**.
The **Fiber architecture** breaks rendering into **incremental, small chunks** so React can:

* **Pause work** (if something more important happens, like user input).
* **Prioritize tasks**.
* **Reuse previously completed work** when possible.
* **Do async rendering (concurrent rendering)**.

In short: **Fiber turns the synchronous rendering process into an incremental one.**

---

## Key Concepts in Fiber

### 1. **Incremental Rendering (Time-Slicing)**

Rendering work is split into **chunks** that can be paused and resumed later.
This avoids blocking the main thread.

---

### 2. **Priority Levels**

React assigns **different priorities** to different updates:

* **High priority:** User interactions like typing, clicking.
* **Low priority:** Data fetching, off-screen rendering.

---

### 3. **Double Buffering (Two Phases)**

React Fiber uses **two main phases**:

1. **Render/Reconcilation Phase (Work Phase)**

   * Builds a new fiber tree.
   * Can be paused, aborted, or restarted.
   * Prepares changes but does NOT commit them to the DOM yet.

2. **Commit Phase**

   * Very fast.
   * Applies all the changes to the DOM in one go.
   * Cannot be paused.

---

### 4. **Linked List of Fibers**

Instead of recursion, React maintains a **linked list of fiber nodes**:

* Each fiber represents a component and its work.
* This enables React to keep track of what work has been done and what remains.

---

## Benefits of Fiber Architecture

1. **Concurrent Mode**: Non-blocking rendering.
2. **Better User Experience**: Smooth animations and responsiveness.
3. **Error Boundaries**: Recover from errors in rendering without crashing the whole app.
4. **Suspense and Lazy Loading**: Built on top of Fiber’s scheduling.

---

## Simplified Flow:

1. React receives an update (state/props).
2. Fiber creates a **work-in-progress tree**.
3. It **processes the tree in chunks**, pausing if necessary.
4. Once ready, it **commits changes to the DOM**.

---

### In summary:

**React Fiber is an advanced reconciliation engine that enables React to work asynchronously, prioritize updates, and deliver a smooth user experience.**

* Draw a **diagram of Fiber architecture**?
* Or explain **how Fiber differs from the old stack reconciler in a table**?

Here’s both a **diagram** and a **table** to make React Fiber architecture clear:

# 1. **Diagram: React Fiber Architecture**

  (Render/Reconciliation Phase)          (Commit Phase)
    - Can be paused                        - Very fast
    - Work split into chunks               - DOM mutations
    - Prioritization                       - Layout effects
    - Can restart/abort                    - Paint to screen
         │                                     │
         └─────────────────────────┬───────────┘
                                   ▼
                           UI Updated on Screen
```

* **Render phase:** React prepares changes (does not touch the DOM).
* **Commit phase:** React applies all changes to the DOM at once.

# 2. **Table: Old React (Stack Reconciler) vs React Fiber**

| Feature                     | Old React (<= v15)     | React Fiber (v16+)                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Rendering**               | Synchronous, recursive | Incremental, interruptible                    |
| **Scheduling**              | No priorities          | Prioritized updates                           |
| **Pausing/Resuming**        | Impossible             | Possible (can pause & resume)                 |
| **Animation/UI smoothness** | Often blocked          | Smooth, non-blocking                          |
| **Error Handling**          | Whole app could crash  | Error boundaries introduced                   |
| **Support for Suspense**    | Not supported          | Supported                                     |
| **Commit Phase**            | Immediate              | Still synchronous, but after incremental work |

# Key Takeaways

* **Fiber is like React’s brain upgrade**: it makes rendering smarter and non-blocking.
* It enables **Concurrent React features** like Suspense and concurrent rendering.
